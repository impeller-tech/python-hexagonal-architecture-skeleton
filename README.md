# Python Hexagonal Architecture Template

A clean and structured template for building Python applications following the Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters) pattern and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The project is organized into the following key directories:

### 📂 `app`

Contains the core of your framework.

### 📂 `src`

Contains the core of your application and the domain logic.

#### 📂 `bounded_contexts`

Contains the bounded contexts of your application.

#### 📂 `modules`

Contains the modules of your application.


### 📂 `tests`

Contains the tests of your application.

## 🎯 Purpose

This template provides a starting point for building applications using Hexagonal Architecture, which offers:

- Clear separation of concerns
- Domain-centric design
- Framework independence
- Highly testable code
- Maintainable and scalable structure

## 🏛️ Architectural Overview

The project follows these key principles:

1. **Domain Layer** (`domain/`)
   - Contains the business logic
   - Pure Python with no external dependencies
   - Defines interfaces (ports) for external operations

2. **Application Layer** (`application/`)
   - Orchestrates the flow of data and implements use cases
   - Coordinates between the domain and infrastructure layers

3. **Infrastructure Layer** (`infrastructure/`)
   - Implements adapters for external services
   - Contains framework-specific code
   - Implements the interfaces defined in the domain layer

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-hexagonal-architecture
```

2. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (if needed):
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

3. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
uv sync --all-groups
```

To install only production dependencies:
```bash
uv sync --no-dev
```

## 📝 Usage

1. Create your bounded contexts under `src/`
2. Define your domain model in the `domain/` layer
3. Implement use cases in the `application/` layer
4. Add adapters in the `infrastructure/` layer
5. Write tests following the same structure in `tests/`

## 🧪 Testing

Run tests using:
```bash
uv run pytest
```

## 📦 Project Dependencies

Dependencies are managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and declared in `pyproject.toml`:

- **Base**: `[project.dependencies]`
- **Production extras**: `[project.optional-dependencies.prod]`
- **Development**: `[dependency-groups.dev]` (e.g. pytest, ruff)
- **Testing**: `[dependency-groups.test]` (e.g. pytest, pytest-cov)

Add dependencies with:
```bash
uv add <package>           # production
uv add --dev <package>      # dev group
uv add --group test <package>  # test group
```
